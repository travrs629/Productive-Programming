# Programming 101

This is a markdown targetted at providing an overview of the current programming situation. Noticeably, as the field of knowledge regarding programming is too big, this programming 101 might not be able to cover all aspects, but the aspects that are interested to me particularly.

Thank you for your time and attention.

## Difference between different programming language

The choices of programming languages are picked using the 15 most used programming languages from the two most popular list by [PYPL ranking Septermber 2022](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) and [Stack Overflow's Developer Survey 2022](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies).

The types of programming languages are classified into `Scriping/Interpreted Language`, `High/Middle Level Language`, `Assembly Language`, `Machine Language` and `Binary Code`. The high level is regarded as `Object-oriented` and the middle level is regarded as `Procedural`.

|language|type|description(what's special)| applications|
|---|---|---|---|
|Python|High/Middle Level Language|1. Extensive libraries available for import<br>2. `Write Once Run Anywhere(WORA)` - can be extended and embedded in any languages and platforms<br>3. Interpreted language - statements are executed one by one, instead of being compiled as a whole (slow execution as a result).<br>4. Simplified Codes and Formatting (also no variable types, resulting in a very high memory consumption).|Pros: <br>- Web Development<br>- Web Scrapping<br>- AI/Machine Learning<br>- Data Analysis<br>- Automated Operation<br><br>Cons: <br>- mobile development|
